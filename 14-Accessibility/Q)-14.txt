> Measure the color contrast ratio of the line in the area charts and the bars in the bar 
  charts against the background. Adjust the visual colors as needed so they have a color contrast ratio of 3:1 against the background. https://contrastchecker.com or Colour Contrast Analyser may be helpful for this requirement.
> Measure the color contrast ratio of the text in one card, one area chart, and one bar chart.
    Adjust the text color of all the cards, area charts, and bar charts as needed so it has a
    color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against the background.
> Add alt text to all non-decorative visuals on the page. Check out this Nightingale article
  if you need some inspiration for writing your alt text. When consuming a Power BI visual with a screen reader, Power BI announces the visual title, the visual type, and then the alt text.
> Update titles to be as descriptive and useful as possible. For visuals, that have the title 
  hidden, add a descriptive title and then turn off the title. For example, the revenues area chart might be titled “Total Revenues by Year in USD, 2005 – 2017”.
> Set the tab order on the page so the page title textbox  (NCAA Revenues & Expenses | 
  Summary View) is first, the year slicer is second, and the Revenues card is third. The 
  Revenues area chart should be fourth and the Revenues bar chart should be fifth. Continue
  this order with the Expenses and Profits visuals.
> Mark any decorative shapes or images (such as the line shape under the page title text box 
  in the provided file) as decorative so it is hidden from tab order.
> Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate the report and do the following:
    Set the year slicer to 2017, review the report, and then clear the slicer selection.
    Select the SEC conference in the Revenues bar chart. Then navigate through the revenues
    area chart to the year 2007 and find the Total Revenues amount.
